# Git Account Test

This document is created for testing purposes. The goal is to ensure that commits are being made with the correct Git account.

## Steps to verify the Git account

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your local Git repository.
3. Run `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` to check the username and email configured in your local repository.
4. If the username and email are not correct, you can set them with `git config user.name "Your Name"` and `git config user.email "youremail@example.com"`.
5. Make a commit and push to the remote repository.
6. Check the commit on GitHub to see if it's associated with the correct account.
